## Abstract

The rapid proliferation of LLM-based agents has produced systems with impressive capabilities but inconsistent reliability. Current discourse focuses on what agents can do—tool use, code generation, web browsing—while neglecting the architectural foundations that determine whether they can do these things reliably. This paper introduces SRAL (State-Reason-Act-Learn), a minimal evaluation framework for reasoning about agent architecture. Unlike perception-oriented loops such as Sense-Reason-Act-Learn or Perceive-Reason-Act, SRAL foregrounds *State*—the constructed, persistent world-model that agents must explicitly maintain—as the foundational component upon which reasoning, action, and learning depend.
